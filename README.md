## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Differences between `style-guide.md` and the `Figma` file.

There were big differences between the 2 files:

- Style guide does not include the font-weight 400. However, 400 font weight is required to be able to complete the design. Font weight 500 is unnecessary and is not included in the final design.
- Shadow data were not mentioned in the `style-guide.md`. These are required to be able to finish the design accurately. The Figma file has them.
- Some of the core color values given in the `style-guide.md` are different than the values in the Figma file.

These two made me lose a little bit of time but actually made the process much more fun, otherwise it is pretty easy to complete the challenge.
